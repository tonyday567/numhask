0.11.0.0
===

* TypeFamilies introduced replacing FunDep usage for QuotientField, AdditiveAction, MultiplicativeAction, Basis. Classes go from Multi-parameter to single.
* EuclideanPair introduced as an intended DerivingVia support for 2 dimensional Basis & Direction instances. 
* Complex modified to use EuclideanPair. Underlying representation changed to tuple and (+:) constructor as a top-level function.
* Action class operators changed from (.\*) to (|\*), and (\*.) to (\*|) etc.
* Ring, Field, Distributive & Module become type synonyms (were classes).
* Added Basis class replacing Norm & Signed
* extra type synonyms added for Basis specialisations: Absolute, Sign, EndoBased.
* abs becomes top-level function (previously method of Norm).
* sign removed and replaced with signum, mirroring Num.
* aboutEqual & nearZero moved outside Epsilon class definition.
* rationalised Language pragmas around GHC2021
* introduced QuotientField instance for Complex & EuclideanPair without Ord constraint.
